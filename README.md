# FEZdoc

FEZdoc is the unofficial brain-dump of everything powering the FEZtool ecosystem â€” docs, notes, examples, and a few chaotic ideas waiting to make sense.

## What is this?

Think of it as the **manual you wish you had** when working on remote sensing tools, Python utilities, and experimental image processing ideas â€” all written in a way thatâ€™s clear, useful, and (hopefully) not boring.

> Work in progress. Iâ€™m documenting as I build, break, and fix.

## Contents

- ðŸ“˜ Tool Documentation â€” How FEZtools work, from CLI to internals
- ðŸ§  Concepts â€” Basics of remote sensing, image processing, etc.
- ðŸ§ª Experiments â€” Prototype ideas and edge-case tests
- ðŸ›  Dev Notes â€” Structure, architecture, testing, packaging tips

## Technologies

This project runs on simple but mighty tools:

## Goals

- Keep documentation **developer-first**
- Avoid academic jargon when possible
- Centralize everything FEZ-related in one place
- Make onboarding new contributors painless
- Help me (and maybe you) stay sane

## License

MIT â€” read, remix, reuse. Just donâ€™t sell it and call it your grandmaâ€™s secret recipe.
